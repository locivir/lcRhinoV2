lcRhino is a RhinocerosÂ® plugin that started to implement idea's of use as a jewelry designer.  
With time more is has become an important tool for me and the designers I've had the pleasure working with.  
I keep developing it as a hobby and progress will depend on available time.  
  
The package should be installed with the Rhino PackageManager.
